"here's something i've learned about people  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip  this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the aftereffects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you  the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our welllit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and selfpreservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was 5 years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's 07 and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right  let me say it again louder for those in the back  we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us  there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation"

"so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and it's about like everybody's like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now i'm just making weird sounds hope you like it"
"and it's a sad picture the final blow hits you somebody else gets what you wanted again and you know it's all the same another time and place repeating history and you're getting sick of it but i believe in whatever you do and i'll do anything to see it through   because these things will change can you feel it now these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution the time will come for us to finally win and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah oh oh   so we've been outnumbered raided and now cornered it's hard to fight when the fight aint fair we're getting stronger now finding things they never found they might be bigger but we're faster and never scared you can walk away say we don't need this but there's something in your eyes says we can beat this   'cause these things will change can you feel it now these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution the time will come for us to finally win and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah oh oh   tonight we stand get off our knees fight for what we've worked for all these years and the battle was long it's the fight of our lives but we'll stand up champions tonight   it was the night things changed can you see it now these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down it's a revolution throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in and we'll sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah hallelujah"

"when i found old diaries from my childhood and my teens they were covered in dust i'm not just saying that for poetic effect they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes i used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments i'd practice my autograph and tape my  picks to the pages in the entries i daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous i was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game i frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love friends confidence and trust i vented described memories in detail jotted down new song ideas and questioned why i would ever try to shoot for a career i had such a small chance of ever attaining  but what shocked me the most was how often i wrote down the things i loved writing a new song riding in the car with my mom the purplepink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting the dazzle of opal necklaces i couldnt afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case i wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such wonderment intrigue romance i noticed things and decided they were romantic and so they were  in life we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be how to act or how to be happy like invisible smoke in the room we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life we constantly question our choices our surroundings and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes all the while we crave romance we long for those rare enchanting moments when things just fall into place above all else we really really want our lives to be filled with love  i've decided that in this life i want to be defined by the things i love not the things i hate the things i'm afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night those things may be struggles but they're not my identity i wish the same for you may your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you turn those voices up in the mix in your head may you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them may you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you didn't i hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed i hope that if there is a lover in your life it's someone who deserves you if that's the case i hope you treat them with care  this album is a love letter to love itself all the captivating spellbinding maddening devastating red blue gray golden aspects of it that's why there are so many songs in honor of fever dreams bad boys confessions of love on a drunken night out christmas lights still hanging in january  string scars on my hands false gods and blind faith memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light finally finding a friend and opening the curtains to see the clearest brightest daylight after the darkest night  we are what we love this is lover"

"according to my birth certificate i turn 0 this year it's weird because part of me still feels 8 and part of me feels 8 but the actual age i currently am is 9 i've heard people say that your thirties are the most fun so i'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought i'd share some lessons i've learned before reaching 0 because it's 09 and sharing is caring  lesson   i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent how youre failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way im showing my friends and fans updates on my life but im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look  im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while im having my coffee at nine in the morning i think its healthy for your selfesteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once  lesson   being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snakeonly bite if someone steps on you  lesson   trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture you had to give me one moment of bitterness come on but that said its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching thats good well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now thats not what i said or do it whatever maybe youll learn from it then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again but its fine do you youre searching  lesson 4  i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day  lesson 5  banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isnt cruel its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it  lesson 6  ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we arent allowed to age its an impossible standard to meet and ive been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women

"where will the music industry be in 0 years 0 years 50 years  before i tell you my thoughts on the matter you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dyingit's just coming alive  there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity i am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently  in recent years you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl i meetis that they all realize their worth and ask for it  music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for it's my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is i hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art  arrows through the heart  in mentioning album sales i'd like to point out that people are still buying albums but now they're buying just a few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone it isn't as easy today as it was 0 years ago to have a multiplatinumselling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us  there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever the way i see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun a passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past  however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans i think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon  i think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no i did not say shock i said surprise i believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans  in the youtube generation we live in i walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before i brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe i hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be  there are a few things i have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs i haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with a frontfacing camera the only memento kids these days want is a selfie it's part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram  fan power  a friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers i see this becoming a trend in the music industry for me this dates back to 005 when i walked into my first recordlabel meetings explaining to them that i had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fansnot the other way around  another theme i see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like countryand to me that's incredible progress i want to make music that reflects all of my influences and i think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a careerdefining path and more of an organizational tool  this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only acceptedit is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all  celebrity spotlight  i predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s '80s and '90s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and i suspect i'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be a bad girl vs good girlcleancut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist i just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to  and as for me i'll just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism  and i'd also like a nice garden"
"my momma stood across the room face to face but never eye to eye recalling words we said the battle that we swore we'd never fight breaking pieces off with every lie a tear came to her eye and she said   don't walk away now and don't rip my heart out don't you block me out tonight honey where are you and don't hate me for loving you   he walked around my life and made blind with every single move he caught me staring at him mad about him little that i knew love is different when you play the fool and all i want to do is say   don't walk away now and don't rip my heart out don't you make cry tonight like you always do and don't hate me for loving you   i slammed the door sat on the floor cried into my bed said are you there do you even care to cross above my head but someone said   don't turn away now and don't rip my heart out things are meant to happen like this i know it's right for you and don't hate me for loving you   i looked up at the sky face to face and finally eye to eye"

"here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the he saidshe said here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us the things we're insecure about and in spite of them we jumped around together under flashing lights fireworks and confetti  to the times i learned by watching you sing along to every song that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me and that even in your worst times they can see the best in you  here's to the musical family i get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing play and dance as well as they do here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party  here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes here's to life teaching us lessons and us learning growing dancing and changing together everything i've learned about a reputation and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you i've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums  thanks to you i'm doing better than i ever was  love taylor"
"spoken writing the song lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter um i wrote it really quick in the middle of the night as soon as i wrote it i knew i wanted it to be the album title and i knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record so it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into and i wrote it alone so i wanted to go in and play it for jack antonoff who i knew who would be the perfect person to produce it and so i walked into the studio and i sat in the piano and this is what happened  so it is it's basically i don't see it as a piano i think it's that like kinda of dreamy y throwback but not like camp throwback so   sung we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january this is our place we make the rules and there's a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear have i known you 0 seconds or 0 years  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out take me home you're my my my my lover  spoken yeah i love the walk down i love the walk down i was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there so the so  sung my my my my lover  we could let our friends crash on the couches this is our place we make the call and i'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you i've loved you three summers now honey but i want 'em all  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out and take me home you're my my my my lover  spoken okay and then i have this  thing that's um essentially well no i was i did i did it in this key but it could be this thing like a key change  so it plays off of the walk downish but it's this is the melody of it it goes it's like  sung ladies and gentlemen will you please stand with every  string scar on my hands i take this magnetic force oh fuck i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue all's well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  spoken wait so goes like  sung and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table i'll save you a seat  spoken so goes and you it goes  sung and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me my heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue all's well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table i'll save you a seat  spoken you like yeah i've never i never do these cords but i was really at the piano like hashing it out yesterday"

"radio dj hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is taylor swift and have you heard this song yet  tim mcgraw i have heard this song  radio dj tim mcgraw and what what did you think the first time you heard it or how was the first time  tim mcgraw it was awesome uh except for i didn't know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old  radio dj ah ha ha ha  tim mcgraw i didn't know which one but the more the more i hear it the more i don't know if its true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that i'm old i don't know if that's true but that's what i choose to think  radio dj why don't we find out taylor is a compliment or uh he's old  taylor swift oh its definitely a compliment yeah laughing  radio dj tim mcgraw meet taylor swift  tim mcgraw nice  taylor swift nice to meet you  tim mcgraw nice to meet you taylor how you doing  taylor swift i'm doing great how are you doing  tim mcgraw i'm doing good congratulations on your record it's doing great  taylor swift thank you so much i'm just so excited thank you for uh having good music and everything i swear i'm not a stalker laughing  radio dj well  taylor swift the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like four hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally 5 minutes and ya know i really didn't think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like we're putting that outlaughing  tim mcgraw well i'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya  radio dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked  tim mcgraw no  radio dj you haven't met  tim mcgraw no  taylor swift no we've never talked or met or anything  tim mcgraw i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i don't remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i don't know if she got it or not  taylor swift oh my god they never gave that to me  tim mcgraw they didn't okay well there ya go i did laughing  radio dj so ii  taylor swift we've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything  tim mcgraw not at all  radio dj so i thought i think it's pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind  taylor swift it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didn't say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn't take it too bad  tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad i'm sure there's plenty that could've been said tell me  taylor swift could you tell faith that i said hello  tim mcgraw i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way  taylor swift oh my gosh she's awesome  tim mcgraw i agree  radio dj this thistell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen  taylor swift well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on i'm gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school  tim mcgraw now i feel old  taylor swift and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are  tim mcgraw aww thank you  taylor swift and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well that's your first single laughing  taylor swift and i'm like well  tim mcgraw well you can write songs about me anytime taylor laughing  taylor swift that's awesome there's a part two coming out next month  tim mcgraw alright great laughing  tim mcgraw well congratulations 'cause it's your first

"we were both young when i first saw you i close my eyes and the flashback starts i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air see the lights see the party the ball gowns see you make your way through the crowd and say hello little did i know  pre  that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said stay away from juliet and i was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go and i said    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all therе's left to do is run you'll be the princе and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes   so i sneak out to the garden to see you we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes escape this town for a little while  pre  'cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter and my daddy said stay away from juliet but you were everything to me i was begging you please don't go and i said    romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel this love is difficult but it's real don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess it's a love story baby just say yes oh oh   i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around my faith in you was fading when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said romeo save me i've been feeling so alone i keep waiting for you but you never come is this in my head i don't know what to think he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said    marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone i love you and that's all i really know i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress it's a love story baby just say yes   oh oh oh oh 'cause we were both young when i first saw you"
"my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character's does its something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment  i'm highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania i'm clutching a  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when i'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room  just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey's anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds i'm convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs   i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when i'm writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever  the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you'd think that as pop writers we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i dont mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 009  in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana  i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book"

"my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in everyone looked worse in the light there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye   i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night but now i see daylight i only see daylight   luck of the draw only draws the unlucky so i became the butt of the joke i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked clearing the air i breathed in the smoke maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now it's brighter now now   i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things i'm never gonna say been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night now i'm wide awake but now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight   and i can still see it all in my mind all of you all of me intertwined i once believed love would be black and white but it's golden golden and i can still see it all in my head back and forth from new york sneaking in your bed i once believed love would be burning red but it's golden like daylight like daylight like daylight like daylight   i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you i can never look away i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you things i'm never gonna say been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night now i'm wide awake but now i see daylight i only see daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight   you gotta step into the daylight and let it go just let it go let it go"

"i used to rule the world seas would rise when i gave the word now in the morning i sleep alone sweep the streets i used to own  i used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemy's eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is dead long live the king  one minute i held the keys next the doors were closed on me and i discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt pillars of sand  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i can't explain once you go there was never never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  it was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldn't believe what i'd become  revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string oh who would ever wanna be king  i hear jerusalem bells aringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field  for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world  for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world"

"is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me i'm not cut out for all these cynical clones these hunters with cell phones   take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die i don't belong and my beloved neither do you those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry i'm setting off but not without my muse   what should be over burrowеd under my skin in heartstopping waves of hurt i'vе come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze tell me what are my words worth   take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die i don't belong and my beloved neither do you those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry i'm setting off but not without my muse   i want auroras and sad prose i want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet 'cause i haven't moved in years and i want you right here a red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground with no one around to tweet it while i bathe in cliffside pools with my calamitous love and insurmountable grief   take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die i don't belong and my beloved neither do you those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry i'm setting off but not without my muse no not without you no not without you"

"jameela jamil presents swift with her award  absolutely love this one right this is sort of a it's not a short speech so just i don't want this to slip and break 'cause it's very important to me  jamil takes the award from swift to hold  thank you so much she's so supportive we all need someone like that i'm taylor good evening i wanna first thank billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for   microphone stand lowers  whoa this is going great so far excellent okay i wanna say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade well it means i've seen a lot when this decade began i was 0 years old and i had put out my selftitled debut album when i was 6 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called fearless and i saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that i was really curious about i saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time  and i saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you whether you deserve to be there whether your male producer or cowriter is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label it wasn't i saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and i saw something in me change due to this realization this was the decade when i became a mirror for my detractors whatever they decided i couldn't do is exactly what i did  audience claps  huh i'll take it thanks whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples i can think of are songs like mean shake it off and blank space basically if people had something to say about me i usually said something back in my own way and this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win album of the year at the grammys and i did become the youngest  artist to ever win the award with that win came criticism and backlash in 00 that i'd never experienced before as a young new artist all of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice was it strong enough was i a little bit pitchy all of a sudden they weren't sure if i was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past i had had cowriters in the room  at that time i couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard i believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever you gotta give it to them and now i realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level i now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback but i didn't know that then  so then i decided that i would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that i would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show i decided i would be what they said i couldn't be i didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else i wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and i would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics  they're saying i'm dating too much in my twenties okay i'll stop i'll just be single for years now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs okay i'll make one about moving to new york and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music alright okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 989  audience cheers  oh you heard it sick now it's that i'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends okay i can stop doing that too now i'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman okay i'll disappear from public view for years now i'm being cast as a villain to you okay here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere  in the last ten years i have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist i really like his songs but i don't know what it is there's just something about him i don't like no that criticism is reserved for us but you know i've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art i've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade lana del rey was ruthly criticized   someone in the audience cheers  yes yeah thank you we have similar tastes i like it she was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into in my opinion the most influential artist in pop her vocal stylings her lyrics her aesthetics they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the grammys because she just kept making art and that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us  and i see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work i absolutely love i see it in lizzo rosalía tayla parx hayley kiyoko king princess camila cabello halsey megan thee stallion princess nokia nina nesbitt sigrid normani her maggie rogers becky g dua lipa ella mai billie eilish and so many other amazing women who are making music right now  female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music onstage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast we are held at a higher sometimes impossiblefeeling standard and it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it it seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger but we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in ar meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room  audience cheers  we now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade and that is the streaming world in music we're always walking handinhand with technology and sometimes that is so awesome like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday i've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes i still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up and i hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers songwriters and creators don't you  audience claps  lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that i feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry and as your resident loud person i feel the need to bring it up and that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate as if it's an app or a shoe line this just happened to me without my approval consultation or consent after i was denied the chance to purchase my music outright my entire catalogue was sold to scooter braun's ithaca holdings in a deal that i'm told was funded by the soros family  capital and the carlyle group  yet to this day none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly to perform their due diligence on their investment on their investment in me to ask how i might feel about the new owner of my art the music i wrote the videos i created photos of me my handwriting my album designs and of course scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale or even when it was announced  i'm fairly certain he knew how i would feel about it though and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but he's always been nice to me when i'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music and of course he's nice to you if you're in this room you have something he needs the fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think according to his own social media post that he could buy me but i'm obviously not going willingly  yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and i will never ever forget it like ever  audience laughs  but to conclude i will say that in ten years i've seen forward steps in our industry in our awareness our inclusion our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct i've seen the advent of social media the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists and i've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before i've leaned on that support and it has kept me in a place where no matter what i always wanted to keep making music for them  i was up on a stage in new york city in 04 accepting billboard woman of the year and i was talking about the future of streaming how we needed to make sure that the female artists writers and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly this was before my record deal with universal last year that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their spotify shares unrecupable so thank you for that  audience cheers  this speech i'm referring to was on my 5th birthday i'm about to turn thirty tonight woo but my exact quote during this speech was i really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians because somewhere right now your future woman of the year is probably sitting in a piano lesson or in a girls' choir and today right now we need to take care of her i've since learned that at that exact moment an year old girl in california really was taking piano lessons and really was in a girls' choir and this year she has been named woman of the year at the age of seventeen her name is billie  audience cheers  and those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry the ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people the ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier makes their night more fun makes their love feel more sacred or their heartache feel less isolating the ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love music and no matter what else enters the conversation we will bring it back to music  and as for me lately i've been focusing less on doing what they say i can't do and more on doing whatever the hell i want thank you for a magnificent happy free confused sometimes lonely but mostly golden decade i'm honored to be here tonight i feel very lucky to be with you thank you so much"

"i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor"

"im writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on november 6th in which ill be voting in the state of tennessee in the past ive been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years i feel very differently about that now i always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights i believe we all deserve in this country i believe in the fight for lgbtq rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong i believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent  i cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all americans no matter their skin color gender or who they love running for senate in the state of tennessee is a woman named marsha blackburn as much as i have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office i cannot support marsha blackburn her voting record in congress appalls and terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women from domestic violence stalking and date rape she believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry these are not my tennessee values i will be voting for phil bredesen for senate and jim cooper for house of representatives please please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values for a lot of us we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 00 on every issue but we have to vote anyway  so many intelligent thoughtful selfpossessed people have turned 8 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do october 9th is the last day to register to vote in the state of tn go to voteorg and you can find all the info happy voting"

"drake talking yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen   drake i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin' and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties  drake talking yeah man it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   drake forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause she's sweet then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the  is good there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this i'm kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and it's kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho  drake talking yeah uh i told ya'll i had a story for you right uh ya man it's what it is   drake and now i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say i'm actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone i'mma hold here down tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and it's dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and it's a shame she had me convinced that she could've been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   drake talking i miss you most of all my darling beat fades out give me a second to gather my thoughts fades back in strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on 'em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing i'm still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby  4 drake i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and we'd assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it's a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin' crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' the face the breast the bras the toes i'm still  and a long night draws to a close cause it's a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we'll never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through yet i can't seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least there's some room to ride there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive  voice strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring"

"the first time the first time i met robyn fenty was 005 she was shooting a music video at a restaurant called avacado in toronto the song was pon de replay and the director and the director of the video was little x i was duced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner it's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called work  today the world knows little x as director x they know me as drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta but eleven years later they still know rihanna as the one and only rihanna  captivating from day one the iconic being that is rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going for them that's often the peak but for her that was a starting point as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since  when it comes to music she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release when it comes to performances they swarm in masses just to be in her presence obviously and when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself which is when it gets a little awkward  what's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats awards and accomplishments what's most impressive is the person some artists need to play a character to achieve success some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in she succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does which is being herself  this woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from barbados surrounded by the same friends speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at ovo fest we love the music which can change styles from album to album we love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year but most of all we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one  she's someone she's someone i've been in love with since i was  years old she's one of my she's one of my best friends in the world all my adult life i've looked up to her even though she's younger than me she's a living breathing legend in our industry ladies and gentlemen the recipient of the michael jackson vanguard award for 06 rihanna"

"connor shell  youre so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can 00 guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show"
