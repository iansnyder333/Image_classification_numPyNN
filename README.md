# Image Classification Neural Network Library from Scratch (IN PROGRESS)

While packages such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are incredible tools for machine learning engineers, building your own models from scratch without the use of such libraries is an incredible way to improve and learn the fundemental mathmatics and statistics that allow machine learning to work. 

The purpose of this package is to store the models ive built from scratch along with their respective functional utilities in a mannor that is scalable and reproducable. This package is for my own development as a machine learning engineer and is not intended to be used as a modeling library.
